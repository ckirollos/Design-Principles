### Interfaces
interfaces define the expected behavior from the concrete classes, by encapsulate a set of them.
When a class implements an interface, it must define those behaviors.

### Interface Segregation Principle states that
no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use

### Intent
Interfaces should be split up in such a way that they can properly describe the separate 
functionalities of the system.

### How to respect the design principle
A poor interface design would entail a single interface for all behaviors of a subsystem, That is this
interface encapsulates a lot. By seperating the interface into smaller interfaces, the concrete classes
would not need to provide implementations for methods that doesn't make sense 
for them (dummy implementations).
