## Design Principles

While design patterns address the common design issues and the struggle of developers everyday,
all design patterns add the needed portion to make a part of the software system more
flexible, maintainable, easy to develop. This happens not only because these design patterns
are tested by experts but also because each pattern respect the design principles, which
are even more general than a design pattern.

Design Principles are all related to the object-oriented design itself, its concepts (inheritance,
encapsulation, abstraction..etc). A software that respects all the design principles through its
development phase is easy to extend, develop not only to meet its goals but to add more.
Some design principles draws on the mathematical nature of some concepts. In general, design
principles are about adding constraints on how to use OOP concepts.
